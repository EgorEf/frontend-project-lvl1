	This is a set of mini-games launched from the console. The set contains 5 mini-games: brain-even, brain-gcd, brain-progression, brain-prime.

	Game rules: the user must give the correct answer to three questions in a row. Any incorrect input is considered an error and is equivalent to an incorrect answer.

1. Brain-even.
	The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd.
2. Brain-calc.
	The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which must be calculated and written down the correct answer.
3. Brain-gcd.
	The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the largest common divisor of these numbers.
Global install package and running Brain-even game.
4. Brain-progression.
	The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a series of numbers, forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two points. The player must determine this number.
5. Brain-prime.
	The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is prime, or "no" if it is composite. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
